# Retrospection
- Have a vision and idea of what you want to achieve and don't be afraid to try it.
- Plan everything. 
- Have a backup plan.
- Simplify e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g - to your best ability.
- Have a backup plan...or at least think about one. You never know when something can go wrong...truly.
- Don't beat yourself up, get back up and try again.
### Recommendations:
- All of the above
- Definitely have a working computer, working software and a backup plan in case things go wrong, like it did for me.
- Check your git global and local configurations before you push to git and your deployment website, particularly if you don't want your email exposed. You might have to rebase your Project back to the very first commit, like I did. -- (Thanks for your help here, Alex and Will)
- Ask for help, even if you feel like a burden and/or utterly clueless.
- Give your brain a rest and sleep earlier than 6am.
- **#Cry** if you need to... ðŸ¥²   - [ no judgment or shame from me --tis healthy when stressed probably but make sure to not give up, get back up and try again :) ] 
- Do not lean on your own understanding...esp if you're still learning.

 ## Unsolved Problems:
- Must solve a bug that I discovered with user-logon.
